CHECK:
- Keep columns like first name, last name
- teamings in one file: 1st, 2nd, Partner
- Export xlsx
- 16 colors for teams
- Color code for disciplines
- Transform from "M/F, First Name, Name, Nationality, Field of Study" to my expected format
- Create hash codes
- (Optional) import xlsx (+ Client accepts xlsx)
- 2nd project: Split up into orange and yellow track after first teaming
- Benachrichtung wenn fertig
- Drag & Drop
- merge progressbar runs
- Icon
- Gender neutral (m=male, everything else -> female)
- 75-85 people -> never less than 4 (-> always assumes 8/16 teams)
- Mehr Epochs (200 -> 20-30 collisions)
- m/f großschreibung (intern wird es lowercased)
- strictly punish collisions
- Inspect why P is not growing that fast (results are too random - maybe because of the first element in P)
  -> first random solution is usually not bad to start with (my heuristic is worse)
  -> P is cleaned up many times due to new better solutions
- Adapted collision measurement and remove manual tweak

TODO:
- Error Reporting
- describe xslx format

[optional]
- Insert intensity
- Select columns of features
- Enter Taste
- Merge progressbars in terminal (intern in dmatcher package)
