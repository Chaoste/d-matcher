CHECK:
- Keep columns like first name, last name
- teamings in one file: 1st, 2nd, Partner
- Export xlsx
- 16 colors for teams
- Color code for disciplines
- Transform from "M/F, First Name, Name, Nationality, Field of Study" to my expected format
- Create hash codes
- (Optional) import xlsx (+ Client accepts xlsx)
- 2nd project: Split up into orange and yellow track after first teaming
- Benachrichtung wenn fertig
- Drag & Drop
- merge progressbar runs
- Icon
- Gender neutral (m=male, everything else -> female)
- 75-85 people -> never less than 4 (-> always assumes 8/16 teams)
- Mehr Epochs (200 -> 20-30 collisions)
- m/f großschreibung (intern wird es lowercased)
- strictly punish collisions
- Inspect why P is not growing that fast (results are too random - maybe because of the first element in P)
  -> first random solution is usually not bad to start with (my heuristic is worse)
  -> P is cleaned up many times due to new better solutions
- Adapted collision measurement and remove manual tweak
- DMatcher: Error Reporting
- Recognize ~ as HOME path
- Spacing & Centering of columns
- Enter Taste works
- Remove key down callback on dismissed popup
- Kivy: Error Reporting UI
- describe xslx format
- generate error txt in HOME directory
- Insert intensity (easy, medium, hard)

TODO:
- Highlight collisions

[optional]
- Make icon border smoother
- Merge progressbars in terminal (intern in dmatcher package)
- Select columns of features (?)
